            <p class="page-text">
              Smart Holders are revolutionary products that make it unnecessary
              to refill bottles. We are selling these products in countries
              where the habit of refilling is not yet established, and are
              promoting a reduction in environmental impact on a global scale.

            <p class="page-text">
              In relation to the recycling of film containers, made from
              composite materials and difficult to recycle from container to
              container, we are working to establish a system for collecting
              them and jointly developing recycling technology. We are promoting
              initiatives that transcend the boundaries of individual companies,
              with the aim of accelerating the transition to a
              resource-recycling society both in Japan and overseas.

              In order to conserve our limited resources for the future, we have
              stopped offering free paper shopping bags at the end of February
              2024. We will continue to encourage customers to bring your
              reusable bags. From March 1st we will offer eco-friendly bags made
              from recycled cotton for a charge.
