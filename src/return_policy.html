            In other cases, depending on the circumstances, a refund may be
            possible. However, please note that we do not offer refunds under
            the following conditions.
          </p>
          <p>Cases where it is difficult to apply the refund policy:</p>

          <p>
            1. You have lost interest in the product due to a change of heart
            <br />

            2. You no longer need the product after purchasing it <br />

            3. You purchased the product by mistake <br />
            4. The product is not what you expected
          </p>

          <p>
            All refunds will be made using the same method of payment as the
            original purchase. Please note that all refunds will be made in the
            same way as the original purchase. We do not accept returns for any
            reason other than the above.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other than this, we do not accept returns or exchanges for products,
            except in the case of defective products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please make sure that the product you are planning to purchase is
            the one you want before placing your order.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of defective products, products subject to a
            manufacturer's recall, or incorrect deliveries, we will replace the
            product or refund the purchase price (in the case of products that
            are no longer available, etc., we will not be able to replace the
            product).
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not accept returns or refunds for customer convenience after
            shipment, but if you really want to, the following fees will be
            charged. In that case, please note that we will not handle returns
            or refunds if you send the product to our store without contacting
            us.
